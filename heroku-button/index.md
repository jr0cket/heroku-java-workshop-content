# Heroku Button

![Heroku Button - Deploy to Heroku](../images/heroku-button-deploy-to-heroku.png)

  **Heroku button** enables anyone to deploy your app with only a web browser, with little or no configuration. Placing an Heroku button on your Github repository or website allows other development teams, QA teams and anyone in your business an easy way to give you feedback on your apps, so you know you are building something valuable.

  A free Heroku account is required to deploy an app via Heroku button. An account can be created during the deployment if you do not already have one.

> **Note** To demonstrate just how easy deployment should be, deploy one or more of the following sample applications using Heroku button

  * [Bare bones Node.js app](https://github.com/heroku/button-sample)
  * [Simple shout-out app in Clojure](https://github.com/jr0cket/shouter)
  * [A simple Iconic app](https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-heroku-button)
  * [Simple Play CRUD application](https://github.com/mkbehbehani/play-heroku-seed)
  * [Web Words](https://github.com/typesafehub/webwords) - example Akka/Scala application on Heroku, created by Typesafe
  * [QuizLive Mobile Template](https://github.com/heroku/mobile-template1) - mobile app template using Node.js & Angular.js
  * [Salesforce Canvas Demo](https://github.com/ccoenraets/salesforce-canvas-demo) - requires a Salesforce Org.
  * [Nibs - a customer loyalty app](https://github.com/heroku/nibs)
  * [Node Articles](https://github.com/heroku-examples/node-articles-nlp) - Node & Express app with Amqp message broker and MongoDB for state (requires a [verified Heroku account](https://heroku.com/verify)).

> **Hint** Later on in the workshop we will show you how to add an Heroku buttom to your own apps.
